# Necromancer-Game
A repo for the necromancer game created by Jack Fletcher within the PRCO304 Final Year Project module at Plymouth University.

Note*

Use space bar to move between VR and first person modes

In first person, controls are a typical WASD control with shift to speed up.

It's most likely more stable within the Unity Editor, but the Build.zip *should* work.
